When the demo starts, it begins with a combination of an explosion effect and fire effect.  The explosion effect is instantaneous, while the fire effect burns for about 6 seconds.  At any time you can mouse click to create an explosion effect at the location of the mouse pointer.  The 's' key may be used to toggle the snow effect.  The explosion effect can continue to be invoked while the snow effect is active.

The demo can be controlled by the following...

* Mouse Click - Create a new 'explosion' effect
* s - Toggle the snow effect
