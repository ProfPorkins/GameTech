# Simple Game Demo
This sample demonstrates the gameplay of a basic game; it does not include menus, high-scores, etc., just the gameplay.

When I was originally working on these demos and the simple game, I was interrupted by a completely separate, and extremely large, side-project that lasted several years.  That project is now complete.  However, I have decided to not return to make any significant revisions to this game.  Only spent enough time to make a few modest code revisions in order to wrap up where I left off.  Even though I'm not finishing what I originally intended, there is quite a bit in it, probably meeting about 75% of my original intention.

There are a bunch more sample game techniques (JavaScript & C++) I'll be working on now, and plan to eventually get a new "simple game" added to this repository.

In order to use this sample, an image from the NASA Hubble Space Telescope site must be downloaded and prepared.  Use the following instructions to prepare the image:

1. Download and install [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php).  Linux systems likely already have this installed.
2. For Windows
   1. Open a Windows Powershell
   2. Navigate to the \TileRendering\assets\graphics\background folder; you might have to create the 'background' folder.
   3. Enter the following commands to download the image:
      * `$url = "https://cdn.spacetelescope.org/archives/images/large/heic0910e.jpg"`
      * `$output = "heic0910e.jpg"`
      * `Import-Module BitsTransfer`
      * `Start-BitsTransfer -Source $url -Destination $output`
   4. Use ImageMagick to crop the image to the necessary dimensions.
      * `magick convert heic0910e.jpg -crop 4480x2560+0+0 +repage cropped.jpg`
   5. Using ImageMagick to generate the image tiles.
      * `magick convert cropped.jpg -crop 128x128 +repage +adjoin tiles%04d.jpg`
3. For Linux
   1. Open a terminal
   2. Navigate to the \TileRendering\assets\graphics\background folder; you might have to create the 'background' folder.
   3. Enter the following command to download the image:
      * `wget https://cdn.spacetelescope.org/archives/images/large/heic0910e.jpg`
   4. Use ImageMagick to crop the image to the necessary dimensions.
      * `convert heic0910e.jpg -crop 4480x2560+0+0 +repage cropped.jpg`
   5. Using ImageMagick to generate the image tiles.
      * `convert cropped.jpg -crop 128x128 +repage +adjoin tiles%04d.jpg`

With the image tiles created, the sample game can be run.  It must be run as a server: `node server.js`.  With the server running, connect to: `http://localhost:3000`
