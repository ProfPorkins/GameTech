A few notes about the demo...

* When movement of the entities is enabled, a quad-tree is rebuilt every frame.  This begins to have an impact on frame-rate after several hundred entities are moving around.  When movement is disabled, the quad-tree doesn't have to be rebuilt each frame, making a big performance improvement with large numbers of entities.
* Rendering of the entities begins to impact performance after a several hundred.
* I have found Chrome and IE to be quite a bit faster than Firefox, especially when building the quad-tree.
* The Edge browser flashes between each animation frame.  I haven't investigated this yet, not sure when I will.
