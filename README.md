Game programming samples and techniques

12/29/2019 - Update

For the past couple of years was distracted by working on a several years long side-project.  That project is now complete and I'm ready, and excited, to return to working on this.

Recently I have returned to working on these code samples.  Some have small revisions like changing from the use of `var` to `let`.  Another is a conversion from using tabs to spaces (I finally caved in!).  Some have larger scope like the change in how keyboard input is handled, due to deprecation of `keyCode` on the keyboard event.  There are some other changes I'd like to make to the code, for example, adding additional capabilities to the particle system.  But for the most part, my intention is to add several significant new JavaScript demos, and then add some C++ demos.  Some of the C++ demos will have overlap with the JavaScript demos, but the purpose is not to creating a matching set of JavaScript/C++ demos.

The following are some of the additions I plan on adding to this repository over the coming months...

* (JavaScript - completed 1/4/2020) Update the particle system example to allow particles to change size over time, also change transparency over time.
* (JavaScript - completed 1/12/2020) Add a set of multiplayer network examples.
* (JavaScript - completed 1/18/2020) Add an Entity-Component-System example.
* (C++ - completed 1/30/2020) Add an Entity-Component-System example.
* (C++ - completed 3/15/2020) Add a set of multiplayer network examples.
* (Both - in progress) Document the JavaScript and C++ multiplayer network examples.

The C++ multiplayer network examples have been written using the ECS model.
