Game programming samples and techniques

12/27/2019 - Code Updates

Today I decided to update these demos to follow the latest revisions/modernizations I've made to these techniques since I originally posted them.  Some changes are simple like a conversion from tabs to spaces (I finally caved in!), while some are semantic in nature like a move to using `let` instead of `var` in most places.  These changes are in preparation for some new JavaScript demos I want to add, ones I've created in the past couple of years that demonstrate multiplayer network programming techniques.  It is also in preparation for a new set of C++ game programming techniques I want to create and add to my repository...those will be longer in coming, months away, not days or weeks.
