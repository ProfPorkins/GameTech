# Multiplayer - Entity Interpolation

Build instructions for the C++ examples are located here (yet to be written).

This sample demonstrates the improvements in networked multiplayer possible using the concepts of Client Prediction, Server Reconciliation, and Entity Interpolation.

Read the documentation description the techniques and overview at this [link](https://github.com/ProfPorkins/GameTech/blob/master/doc/Multiplayer/Multiplayer-Step-3.md), then come back to this document and read the specifics regarding the C++ implementation here.
