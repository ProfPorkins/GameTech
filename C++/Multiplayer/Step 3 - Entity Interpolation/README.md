Build instructions for the C++ examples are located here: [link](https://github.com/ProfPorkins/GameTech/blob/trunk/doc/Multiplayer/Developer-Setup-cpp.md)

This sample demonstrates the improvements in networked multiplayer possible using the concepts of Client Prediction, Server Reconciliation, and Entity Interpolation.

Read the documentation description the techniques and overview at this [link](https://github.com/ProfPorkins/GameTech/blob/trunk/doc/Multiplayer/Multiplayer-Step-3.md), then come back to this document and read the specifics regarding the C++ implementation here.
